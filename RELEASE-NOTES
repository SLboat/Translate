== Translate 2013.04 ==
Released at 2013-04-30.

=== Highlights ===
Work continued on stabilizing the new Translate UX (TUX) interface.

Specifically, numerous fixes were made to make TUX work correctly in Microsoft Internet Explorer.

The "message tools menu" was added to give easy access from the message translation interface to the history of the message and to translations in all languages (Special:Translations).

Basic file format support was added for Xliff.

Initial work was done to add support for sandboxing - allowing users to make several test translations before getting full translation permissions. This is an incomplete experimental feature and it is not active by default.

=== Noteworthy changes ===
* Removed the hide tab that appeared even though there were no more warnings.
* Messages saying that there is nothing to proofread were clarified.
* Show "Cancel" instead of "Skip" at the last message in the curent view.
* Clicking a suggestion copies the suggestion to the translation field (previously, a user had to press a link, which was harder).
* Simple paging for translation search results.
* <tvar|> no longer visible on translation pages in source language (bug 46925)
* The bottom toolbar is always shown, even without a scroll.
* When a user modifies a translation, it is no longer proofreadable (bug 46687)
* Numerous minor styling changes.
* RTL fixes for Special:Magic, to ensure cleaner display of magic words
  in right-to-left translations.
